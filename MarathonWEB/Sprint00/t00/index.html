<h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>
<p>
    superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could
    possess, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be
    considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or
    detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it
    becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t
    accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

<h2>My favorite superhero</h2>

    Hal Jordan

    Originally my favourite Green Lantern was John Stewart and I knew more about Kyle Rayner than Hal Jordan but since
    hearing the hype about the Sinestro Corps War, I read Blackest Night and started collecting the Geoff Johns Green
    Lantern series. This showed me what a brilliant character Hal is. His determination, cockiness and ability to
    continue moving forward in spite of his past made for a compelling character arc in my eyes. As such, Hal is now my
    favourite Green Lantern of them all.
